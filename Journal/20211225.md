How do EMR's/ EHR's work

EMR's (electronic medical records) are digital ways of storing **medical** information. These normally stay within a provider and does not move with the patient. On the otherhand,  EHR's store Health information and is meant to be more holistic and is meant to travel witht he patient

For EHR's Marketshares Epic takes up 28%, Cerner takes 26%, and Meditech takes 16%

Findings on Epic: [https://healthcare-communications.imedpub.com/a-comprehensive-review-of-an-electronic-health-record-system-soon-to-assume-market-ascendancy-epic.pdf](https://healthcare-communications.imedpub.com/a-comprehensive-review-of-an-electronic-health-record-system-soon-to-assume-market-ascendancy-epic.pdf)

And these systems cant talk to each other, which leads to greater separation and less patient choice since switching EHR's is difficult for doctors so they dont get recommended to places with competing EHR's

[[Interoperability]] between EHR's have been improving according to surveys of providers and hospitals with Epic and Cerner starting to improve data integration...?

Report on increased data exchanges between epic and other vendors: [https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/facas/GSG_TestimonySupport_CarlDvorak_2014-08-15_04.pdf](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/facas/GSG_TestimonySupport_CarlDvorak_2014-08-15_04.pdf)

but that only came after a fierce fight where epic turned around and started to support interoperability:

Maybe thats because of fear of the public changing their opinion on epic?
