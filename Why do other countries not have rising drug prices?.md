'refusing to pay higher prices for new drugs that do not improve effectiveness of treatment over existing options.

 [Germany](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20161229.058150/full/) has allowed manufacturers to freely set prices for a limited period when bringing new drugs to the market. It then uses the data available from that period for a nongovernmental and nonprofit research body to evaluate the benefit provided by the new drug, as compared to existing alternatives. This added benefit, or lack thereof, then serves as the foundation for price negotiations between drug manufacturers and health plans.'

 Why does this happen? Branded prescription drugs are 20% to 40% cheaper in Europe in large part because the [national health plans there drive hard bargains](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16966733). The state-run buyers can impose price caps, or even refuse to allow a drug onto a national formulary if they think it is not worth the cost.
 
 
 Every other developed country regulates drug prices, often through price negotiations pegged to cost-effectiveness analysis or some other measure of clinical benefit.
