## Research on Telemedicine

Pubmed article about current state of telemedicine, 2020: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7437610/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7437610/)

* only 16 states provide reimbursement for store and forward services, 23 for remote patient monitoring
* During pandemic, all medicare patients can get access to telemedicine equivalents
* Each state has its own unique regulations around telemedicine and how its reimbursed
* THe US uses more telemedicine services by a lot compared to other countries
* Telemedicine has been used a method of e-triaging, traigaginc before they hit the ER.
* Barriers that currently exist to telemedicine that have been noted include a lack of education about the efficacy and safety of telemedicine in light of current circumstances, patient preferences regarding seeing their own provider as opposed to someone with whom they have no established relationship, a lack of understanding about how to access telemedicine visits, and a lack of knowledge about having telemedicine visits as an option.
* Telemedicine has been lower cost, probably given by the increased throughput, use of cheap to free technology like facetime, messenger.
* " a majority stated that they would prefer to use telemedicine rather than in-person visits in the future."
* "mericans spend an average of 123 min per visit, with an average face-to-face time with a physician of 20.5 min.[34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7437610/#R34) Telemedicine appointments may virtually eliminate travel and waiting times, dramatically increasing the proportion of patients’ face-to-face time with their physicians."

My personal thoughts
* I think a barrier to overcome is the cost of devices. If we want more telemedicine, devices that can aid in more specific diagnoses must be cheaper and easier to distribute as there will be more necessary
* People will need to be ok with not having a specific doctor they see all the time. Transfer of knowledge from doctor to doctor will have to be fast and efficient, EHR's will have to display whats important quickly
