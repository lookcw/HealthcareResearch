ACA exchanges refer to the public market of insurance plans that are offered by public (Healthcare.gov) or private insurers

these exchanges are the only place people can obtain premium subsidies and cost-sharing reductions, which serve to reduce premiums and out-of-pocket costs for millions of eligible enrollees, but you can only get these savings if you purchase them on the exchange.
