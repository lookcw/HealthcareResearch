How does the Drug Supply chain work

[[Supply Chain Inefficiencies]]

41% of revenue in pharma is spent on intermediates in the supply chain

intermediates can make as much as manufacterers which is a bit insane given that manufacturers are the ones spending money on development


Drug supply chain 

1. manufacturer (abbvie, merck, etc)
	1. Company that does drug development
2. wholesaler (Mckesson, etc)
	1. Company that buys in large quantities (I guess they guarantee distribution for drug makere)
3. Pharmacies
	1. CVS, Walgreens, somewhat the end distributor
4. Patient

Who takes money?
Manufactuer
[[Pharmacy Benefit Managers]]
Payers
Wholesalers
