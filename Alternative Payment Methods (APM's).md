An APM is a payment model that deviates from traditional fee-for-service.

A common example of an APM is a Medicare Shared Savings Plan (MSSP) also known as an Accountable Care Organization (ACO).

Under an MSSP, if the organization can realize savings by providing high-quality and low-cost care to a defined group of Medicare beneficiaries seen by the providers participating in the MSSP, Medicare will share the savings with the ACO.

Physician lead APM's tend to have higher savings 

-   Hospital-led ACOs: 1–2%
-   Physician-led ACOs: 3–5%
-   Hospital-led bundled payment: 3–5%
-   Physician-led bundled payment: 5–8%


"To qualify as participating in an APM a physician must receive a certain amount of fee-for-service revenue. This threshold has been too high for many physicians who primarily see Medicare Advantage Patients."- [https://www.carecloud.com/continuum/alternative-payment-models-overview/](https://www.carecloud.com/continuum/alternative-payment-models-overview/)

These models generally tend to fall under value based care where providers are rewarded for providing better care.
