## Research: Why insulin in took so long to be genericized

The global human insulin market size stood at **USD 21.26 billion in 2018**  while the us drug market in 2018 was **about $484.8 billion**

insulin was about 5% of the drug market.

[[EverGreening]] - patent extensions that accept small changes as innovation thereby granting longer patent protection.

Pay to delay generic delays - current insulin manufacturers pay competitiors to not copy specific drugs for a period of time (what)

Insulin is a biologic (an organic molecule produced by an organism) as opposed to ibuprofen which can be manufactured without organisms. Costs nearly as much as a novel drug (are you fucking kidding me is it that hard)
