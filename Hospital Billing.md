Over 80% of medical bills contain errors. These errors (obviously) always favor over rather than undercharging

SOme of this is intentional, where a provider will upcharge a code by charging for a more expensive code. if a coder indicates heart failure instead of acute systolic heart failure with a slightly different ICD-9 code, the provider can charge thousands of dollars more.

It looks like there has to be policy changes around this so either auditing or coding has to be done better, closer to the actual cost of the service. Imo I think the solution is value based care, or rather the problem is fee for service. Hospitals are incentivized across the board, (which means consultants are too) to hand out more diagnoses, treatments, etc, rather than do the right ones. In a value based care model, upcoding doesnt matter. The industry (rightfully imo) disappears.

Policy also needs to exist to make it more transparent, so that markets can exist to combat from the otherside, to get an itemized list and see whats bullshit and whats not. especially for standard procedures.
