Successes:

Uninsured fell from 17% to 10%

Banned differential treatment by insurers for preexisting conditions
Decreased rate of increase of spending by insurers
30% of Medicare payments are flowing through alternative payment methods (not fee for service) up from 0% in 2010

Failures:
The source of insurance has been different than expected, many came from Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) which, while the [[ACA exchange program]] covered 10 million fewer people.

Out of pocket expenses have increased
The slowdown of spending in healthcare has also been attributed to the recession.
