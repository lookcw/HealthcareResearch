Evergreening is repatenting/ extending the patent of drugs that already exist. This can be done in many ways:

**Hatch-Waxman act:**  This allows patent extensions up to 5 years to make up for the time the FDA needs to approve a drug

A **new method of administration** (chewable instead of dissolvable) or **use** (a naseau drug used for motion sickness being used for pregnancy sickness) can also grant 3 years of additional patent protection. This is how a company can claim novelty, while protecting the same drug. (what i dont understand is why the drug on old uses is still protected.) (Maybe thats difficult becaues if the drug is the same, can u really regulate its usage well? I feel like yes but maybe no?)
